#Coding Guidelines
Write your queries in query.py
Query for each question is to be assigned to a variable in the above python file. Variables for each question are specified individually.
Schema for the tables that are to be used for following tasks

 Actor (  
	 id integer PRIMARY KEY,
	 fname varchar(250),  
	 lname varchar(250), 
	 gender varchar(10) 
 );

 Movie(  
	 id integer PRIMARY KEY, 
	 name varchar(250), 
	 year integer, 
	 rank integer
 );
	
 Director(  
	 id integer PRIMARY KEY, 
	 fname varchar(250), 
	 lname varchar(250)
 );

Cast(
        pid integer,
        mid integer,
        role varchar(200)
    );

MovieDirector(
        did integer,
        mid integer
    );

Cast stores the cast data i.e the actors who acted in each movie.

pid - actor id
mid - movie id
role - role of the actor with id equal to pid in movie with id equal mid
Similar to Cast, MovieDirector stores movie directors data i.e the directors for each movie
